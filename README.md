# Telegram Bot using Agentic RAG (But now with Dashboard)

Following the experiment on [Telegram Bot using Agentic RAG](https://github.com/0xhatsume/agentic-tg-rag), 
I now need a dashboard to iterate on settings and monitor more bots than one. Also there are other friends who want to co-use it. 
So I have to have a control center of sorts.
Here we try to use Supabase as backend as much as possible.
